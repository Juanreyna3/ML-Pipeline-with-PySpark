# ML-Pipeline-with-PySpark

Developed a Random Forest pipeline using PySpark MLlib, performed cross validation and hyperparameter tuning to select the best model from the pipeline and evaluated the best model's performance.

- Loaded, described, and cleaned a data from a CSV file using PySpark
- Constructed a Random Forest pipeline and a 3-fold cross validator for hyperparameter tuning
- Trained and tested 2 models to predict car prices, evaluated each model's performance via several metrics (Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared) 
- Extracted the best-performing model
