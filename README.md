# ML-Pipeline-with-PySpark


Description to be updated:

Learn how to load your dataset in Spark and learn how to perform basic cleaning techniques such as removing columns with high missing values and removing rows with missing values. You will then create a machine learning pipeline with a random forest regression model. You will use cross validation and parameter tuning to select the best model from the pipeline. Lastly, you will evaluate your modelâ€™s performance using various metrics.

- loaded a dataset in PySpark 
- described and cleaned dataset 
- created a Random Forest pipeline to predict car prices 
- created a cross validator for hyperparameter tuning
- trained a mode and predicted test set car prices
- evaluated the model's performance via several metrics (RMSE, MSE, MAE, , R^2)
