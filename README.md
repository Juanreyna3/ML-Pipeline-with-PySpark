# ML-Pipeline-with-PySpark


Description to be updated:

Constructed a machine learning pipeline with a random forest regression model and used cross validation and parameter tuning to select the best model to evaluate from the pipeline.

- loaded a dataset in PySpark 
- described and cleaned dataset 
- created a Random Forest pipeline to predict car prices 
- created a cross validator for hyperparameter tuning
- trained a mode and predicted test set car prices
- evaluated the model's performance via several metrics (RMSE, MSE, MAE, , R^2)
